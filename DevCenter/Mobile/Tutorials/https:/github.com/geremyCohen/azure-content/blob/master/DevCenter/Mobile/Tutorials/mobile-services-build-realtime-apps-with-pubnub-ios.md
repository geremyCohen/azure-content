#**iOS SimpleSubscribe in 10 minutes with PubNub 3.4 on iOS**

This HOWTO will walk you through setting up a simple PubNub 3.4 for iOS "Hello World application". Its a super-simplified walkthrough which utilizes existing code to get you running quickly.

If you'd instead prefer a more robust PubNub iOS example, please refer to the iPad sample app which ships as a demo, available at https://github.com/pubnub/objective-c/tree/master/iOS.

The first step is to clone the PubNub objective-c repo:

**$ git clone https://github.com/pubnub/objective-c.git**

This will create PubNub-related files within a subdirectory called *objective-c* in the same directory you run the command from. You will need these files later.
##***Create a new PubNubDemo XCode Project***

Lets first start with a new blank Xcode project. To create the new project:

1.Open Xcode  
2.Select **File -> New -> Project** from the menu.

The **"Choose a template for your new project"** dialog will appear.  


3.Select **iOS -> Application -> Single View Application.**  
4.Click **"Next"**


The **"Choose options for your new project"** dialog will be shown next.  

**NOTE:** In order to make this HOWTO as easy as possible to follow, these following values are   suggested:  



**NOTE:** Don't actually enter **"XYZ"** for "Class Prefix". Leave it blank, and it will display "XYZ" as placeholder text.

5.Click the **"Next"** button to proceed.  
6.Select the folder which to save the project.  
7.Click the **"Create"** button.

The template project is now created!

Next, we'll import and configure the PubNub libraries we obtained from the git clone performed earlier.

##Import and Configure the PubNub Libraries

1.Open a Finder window to the directory created by the previous "git clone", and select the 
**objective-c/iOS/3.4/pubnub/libs** directory.


2.Drag the **libs** directory from the Finder window to just below the file **ViewController.xib** in your Xcode project's Project view.  


The **"Choose options for adding these files"** dialog will appear.  


3.Select **"Destination: Copy items into destination group's folder"** and **"Add to targets"**  
4.Click **Finish.**

**NOTE:**  Be sure **"Copy items into destination groups folder"** and **"Add to targets"** is selected for *PubNubDemo* when copying any files from the Finder into the project.

Next, we'll add the "PNImports.h" import statement to the **PubNubDemo-Prefix.pch** file.

5.Delete **PubNubDemo-Prefix.pch** from the path *PubNubDemo/Supporting Files* in Project Navigator.

The **Move To Trash** dialog appears.  


6.Select **"Move to Trash"**.  
7.Drag **objective-c/HOWTO_3.4/PubNubDemo/PubNubDemo-Prefix.pch** back to 
*PubNubDemo/Supporting Files* in Project Navigator

The **"Choose options for adding these files"** dialog will appear.  


8.Select **"Destination: Copy items into destination group's folder"** and **"Add to targets"**   
9.Click **Finish.**

**NOTE:** Be sure  **"Copy items into destination groups folder"** and  **"Add to targets"** is selected for "PubNubDemo" when copying files from the Finder into the project.

##Disable ARC for Global JSON Support
The JSONKit library is supplied to make supporting all iOS target versions seamless and easy. Since   JSONKit library is a non-arc library, we need to tell Xcode to compile these files without ARC.

1.From *Project Navigator* (the 1st vertical Xcode pane), click on the project name **PubNubDemo**    
2.In the 2nd pane, click *PubNubDemo* under **"Targets"**.    
3.In the 3rd pane, from the top horizontal tab menu, click *Build Phases*     
4.Expand *Compile Sources*  
5.Command-click **JSON.m** and **JSONKit.m**  
6.Press **Enter** to open a flags textfield  
7.Paste in the string **-fno-objc-arc**  


8.Press **Enter** when done.

Next, we need to define the additional framework support required to run our PubNub application. From the current *Build Phases* screen:

9.Close (un-expand) the *Compile Sources* dropdown. 
10.Expand *Link Binary With Libraries* dropdown.  
11.Click the + button  
12.Add **CFNetwork.Framework**  
13.Add **libz.dylib**  
14.Add **SystemConfiguration.Framework**


##Modify the App Delegate files
App delegate logic can handle many PubNub-related tasks, such as receiving messages. We'll implement the didReceiveMessage delegate in this example.

1.Modify your **AppDelegate.h** file. Your line 13 should look like this:

    @interface AppDelegate : UIResponder<UIApplicationDelegate, PNDelegate>

2.Modify your **AppDelegate.m** file. Immediately after @implementation AppDelegate at  line 13, add the following delegate method:

    - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didReceiveMessage:(PNMessage *)message {
      PNLog(PNLogGeneralLevel, self, @"PubNub client received message: %@", message);
    }

3.Modify your **AppDelegate.m** file. Immediately before the returnYES; statement, in the

    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions

method, add the following:

    [PubNubsetDelegate:self];
##Modify the ViewController files:
1.Modify your **ViewController.m** file. Immediately after [super viewDidLoad]; add the following code to make PubNub connect and subscribe just as the view loads:


     // amongst other things, set the sub/pub keys to demo
    [PubNub setConfiguration:[PNConfiguration defaultConfiguration]];

    [PubNubconnectWithSuccessBlock:^(NSString *origin) {
    PNLog(PNLogGeneralLevel, self, @"{BLOCK} PubNub client connected to: %@", origin);

        // wait 1 second
    int64_t delayInSeconds = 1.0;
    dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC);
    dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){

    // then subscribe on channel a
    [PubNubsubscribeOnChannel:[PNChannelchannelWithName:@"a"shouldObservePresence:YES]];

        });
    }
    // In case of error you always can pull out error code and identify what happened and what you can do
    // additional information is stored inside error's localizedDescription, localizedFailureReason and
    // localizedRecoverySuggestion)

    errorBlock:^(PNError *connectionError) {
        if (connectionError.code == kPNClientConnectionFailedOnInternetFailureError) {

            // wait 1 second
            int64_t delayInSeconds = 1.0;
            dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC);
            dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
                    PNLog(PNLogGeneralLevel, self, @"Connection will be established as soon as internet connection will be restored");
                   });
            }
            UIAlertView *connectionErrorAlert = [UIAlertViewnew];
            connectionErrorAlert.title = [NSStringstringWithFormat:@"%@(%@)",
                    [connectionError localizedDescription],
                    NSStringFromClass([selfclass])];
            connectionErrorAlert.message = [NSStringstringWithFormat:@"Reason:\n%@\n\nSuggestion:\n%@",
                    [connectionError localizedFailureReason],
                    [connectionError localizedRecoverySuggestion]];
            [connectionErrorAlert addButtonWithTitle:@"OK"];

            [connectionErrorAlert show];
    }];



##Completed!
Now, when you run your application, you should see all messages published to the channel in the log. By default because we are using defaultConfiguration, the subscribe key is set to **demo**, and via the subscribeOnChannel call, listen on channel **a**.
